As part of an undergraduate finance class, I was tasked with this Harvard case study project studying the potential expansion of 5 new Target store locations. Taking the perspective of an internal analyst presenting to the Target capital expenditure committee, I analyzed the financial and other qualitative aspects of each potential expansion project. At the time, these were actual expansion targets for Target, and I was solely responsible for the entire analysis. I created a quantitative scoring system to analysis a number of variables in order to fairly compare each potential expansion. This project taught me to find a way to quantify variables that at first may seem somewhat abstract, and how to compare that variable and to others.

### Executive Summary

To show shareholders our commitment to the aggressive growth strategy of opening 100 new stores each year, ten new Capital Project Requests (CPRs) will be discussed at the next CEC meeting. Half of the projects must be evaluated in greater detail using a comprehensive quantitative score that considers the NPV, IRR, R&P forecasts, prototype benchmark risk, surrounding demographics, and competition, as well as a qualitative analysis that considers the other strengths and weaknesses of each project.

Base on this analysis, The Barn, Stadium Remodel, Gopher Place, and Whalen Ct projects should all be accepted due to their strong financials, demographic growth opportunity, and/or strategic competitive opportunity. Only one of the five borderline projects should be rejected–Goldie Square–because its store IRR is less than the store hurdle rate, it has high internal competition, and is expected to greatly underperform its prototype benchmark. If funding all approved projects exceed the CPR budget, bonds should be used as an external funds source.
