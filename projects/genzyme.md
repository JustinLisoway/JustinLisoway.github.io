As part of an undergraduate finance class, I was tasked with this Harvard case study project studying the potential acquisition of one pharmaceutical company by another. The goal was to take the place of a financial analyst and submit an acquisition analysis of Genzyme to its board of directors. This was a real-life acquisition target at the time of the case study. I was solely responsible for analyzing the quantitative financial aspects of the potential deal, as well as what synergies and other qualitative aspects may be of benefit or detriment to Genzyme. This project provided me with exposure to the qualitative side of M&A, because a major part of my analysis ended up being the value added by the expansion of Sanofi's drug portfolio, rather than what Genzyme is worth on its own.


### Executive Summary

Following a $69 per share tender offer from Sanofi-Aventis to acquire Genzyme and an open letter to Genzyme shareholders expressing their frustration with Genzyme executives, the Genzyme Board of Directors must determine through a quantitative and qualitative analysis what the Genzyme corporation is worth. Quantitatively, the market-based valuation values Genzyme at $71.80 per share and the management-based valuation values Genzyme at $90.89 per share. Pipeline revenues are the key difference between these valuations. The qualitative analysis provides support for management’s perspective and discusses other qualitative value of Genzyme from Sanofi’s perspective including drug diversification, market penetration, and complementary patent cliffs. It is recommended that the Genzyme Board of Directors counteroffer Sanofi-Aventis with management’s valuation of $90.89 per share and otherwise address the concerns of its shareholders.
