Why use a potentially creatively restraining UI framework, when one could write all of the CSS and HTML on their own?

I see two reasons: *the individual may be slower, and the team WILL be slower*.

Choosing to bypass a UI framework fails to acknowledge the improvement in efficiency that a programmer can see once they master a useful UI Framework, and the massive improvement in a team’s efficiency if they are all using and understand the same UI framework.

### The Individual May Be Slower

Take Bootstrap for example. After basic HTML and CSS training, anyone could create a basic/mediocre looking webpage. It might take up to an hour for a newbie to give it some nice coloring, images, and make the margins look good, and that’s only if they know everything they need to know. However, with many of these basic design parameters built in to the HTML/CSS before you even start, makes these basic things a lot faster to design. Even the act of switching between CSS and HTML for almost every design change takes time, not to mention the time it takes to create (from scratch) a basic blueprint for the website and write unnecessary CSS—this time is saved when using bootstrap classes for example. I could go on and on listing every little operation that a programmer might do, which is done marginally faster using an efficient framework compared to manually building and expending creative energy to do so.

Now extrapolate that to an experienced programmer who needs to make an incredibly complex and beautiful website. Just consider the runtime alone it takes for this programmer to create the site if at every turn he/she must switch back to CSS, expend creative energy to think up a basic design layout, spend the time coding it, and hopefully not make any trivial mistakes along the way. These problems are lessened by using a good UI Framework, like bootstrap. However, I believe these problems are only the root of the major problem I see occurring in the real-world—site maintenance, and working as a team.

  
### The Team WILL Be Slower

If one person alone designs and maintains a site, then they maybe be a bit slower using their own code, but they could at least not be restricted by the framework (to any extent that a framework may be creatively constricting, which can be overridden anyways). However, when working as part of a team, it is easy to see that it would be exponentially more useful to use a UI framework. If everyone is using the same basic CSS classes, for example, then team member waste no time relearning what each CSS class is doing. This alone would solve a lot of problems in combing parts to create a good website. Furthermore, in the future, different programmers will be looking through this HTML and CSS code, which would require them to study and learn all of the CSS which could have been written years ago. This could be extremely time consuming if the code did not implement a good framework; however, if they know that Bootstrap was used (for example) this eliminates the need to review almost all of the CSS, because the programmer should already be familiar with the Bootstrap framework and all its classes.
