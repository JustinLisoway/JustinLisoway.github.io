<h3 id="discovery-to-captivation">Discovery To Captivation</h3>

<p>In all honesty, I never thought I would like programming. I was only ever interested in making money, which is why I pursued a master’s degree in finance. I thought that would at least teach me how to grow a business. It wasn’t until my brother (who is a software engineer) had asked me to beta test an app he has been working on, that I was exposed to that part of the process.</p>

<p>Speaking to my father recently about what I want to do after I graduate, I said that I am really not sure yet. He told me to just do what I enjoy, and do it well enough that other people will pay me for it. The only activity that came to mind, where time passes so quickly that I could work all day and even forget to eat, was programming. I knew then I had to pursue this. I later discovered it is the challenge that captivates me. It is the continuous problem-solving nature that demands every neuron’s attention in my brain. This is true so much so that hours can go by and it feels like a blink of the eye. Each new problem requires my full and undivided attention to solve and I love that element of it.</p>

<h3 id="a-required-tool-for-the-modern-world">A Required Tool For The Modern World</h3>

<p>My ultimate goal in my career, probably not unlike many other people interested in programming, is to own a business that is working on something unique and important. My interests in terms of what that could be are boundless. I know a lot about the finance industry already, which suggest that I should focus my attention on solving problems there.</p>

<p>This does spark my interest, but only in the sense that if I could find a problem in finance and figure out a solution to it, I want to be equipped with the knowledge and tools in order to implement that solution. In its essence, that is exactly what I want to gain from pursuing computer science. I want the knowledge and tools to (almost singlehandedly) get started on an idea that could solve a real-world problem, and see where it takes me.</p>

<p>From a broad perspective, this might seem daunting, overwhelming, and not even a clear goal. However, to imagine a future where I do recognize a significant problem in the world and I have an idea to fix it, but I am not equipped with the ability to solve that problem, is far more overwhelming. If I am ever going to solve a real-world problem, I want and need a full set of tools for the modern world.</p>
